# My Projects

## Cage

This is a Research project. Initiated by Dr. Jiecong Lin of Harvard University, I joined his team and began research and development.

This project reduces the time complexity of analyzing ChIP-nexus data by constructing efficient and accurate models through Deep Learning techniques.

1. Tech
    - Machine Learning Framework: pyTorch
    - Library: pyBigWig, numpy, pandas, tqdm, sklearn, json

2. Features
    - Data Preprocessing: 
        - Construct an extractor for FASTA files, primarily for extracting and processing DNA sequence information to ensure that their format and content meet the requirements of the model inputs.
        - Build a system to read the .bed file and extract peaks from it, then map these peaks to the corresponding signal intensity index in the .bw files.
    - Fit: 
        - Data Loading and Transfer to GPU: Loads data from the training set and ensures they are on the GPU.
        - Model Preparation: Clears the optimizer state and puts the model in training mode.
        - Forward Pass: Runs the model to get predictions, applies the softmax function to the predictions, and then computes the loss.
        - Backward Pass and Update: Computes the gradients of the loss and performs a step of gradient descent.
    - Losses:
        - A MSE loss function.
        - A multinomial negative log-likelihood loss function.
    - Predict:
        - Construct a trained model to analyze new DNA sequences and predicts the distribution of the signal intensity of protein-DNA interactions across the genome

## [Revive](https://github.com/BinL233/Revive)

Revive is a Focus App for iOS, based on taking care of endangered or extinct species. In Revive, you can take care of a species from 0 to 1, starting with an egg. For your  species to thrive, you need to do anything in a focused way-----such as studying, working, or other activities, which is the core of Revive.

To see the repository, please check [this link](https://github.com/BinL233/Revive)

1. Tech
   - Frontend: SwiftUI
   - Backend: Swift, CloudKit
   - Database: CoreData
2. Features
    - Focus
        1. The focus mechanism detects if the user is leaving the application. This prevents the user from doing other things. 
        2. For the timer, users are free to set the time they want to focus on.
        3. There are three kinds of focus approaches: hatching, training and exploring. 
            - Hatching: 
                - Hatching eggs through focus. 
                - Eggs are randomly assigned to the user, and eggs from different types of Secipes take different amounts of time to hatch.
                - Users can choose their own focus time, which is used to reduce the amount of time remaining for the egg to hatch. (In other words, egg hatching doesn't need to be done all at once, it can be done by multiple Focuses)
            - Training: 
                - Training users' own species through focus. 
                - The longer users focus, the higher EXP users' species gain.
            - Exploring: 
                - Exploring through focus. 
                - Users can select a time period for the focus. The exact time is random in the selected time period. 
                - The longer users focus, the higher probability of getting rare items.
    - Backyard
        1. Users can check their species in the Species List. Species List contains information about each species.
            - Name
            - Date of birth
            - Level
            - Sex
        2. Users can take care of their species by feeding them. The items gains by exploring.
    - Analysis
        1. Users can view the history of focus records as well as time distribution graphs.
        2. Users can categorize the view by action and time span.
    - Cloud Sync
        1. Cloud Sync will automatically store user information. 
        2. The users' data will be stored in their iCloud.
    - Setting
      1. Focus
        -  Keep Screen On
          - Users can set it on if you want.
      2. Notification
        - Notification
            - Notification switch helps users turn on/off the notification.
        - Reminder
            - Reminder will remind users to start focusing by sending the notification.
            - Users can set the reminder time in this field.
    - Notification
        - If the time set by users is reached, the user will be alerted via notification.
